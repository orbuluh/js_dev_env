# Quick Intro and Usage Guide for `fzf`

[Examples](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/wiki/examples)

## What is `fzf`?

`fzf` is a powerful command-line fuzzy finder that lets you quickly search through and select from lists, such as files, directories, or other data. Itâ€™s highly customizable and integrates well with other commands and workflows.

- **Interactive Selection**: `fzf` reads input from standard input (STDIN), displays the list interactively for searching and selection, and outputs the chosen items to standard output (STDOUT).
- **Versatile Use**: Use it to navigate files, directories, git commits, and more.

## Basic Usage Examples

### Example 1: Search Files with `find` and `fzf`

```bash
find * -type f | fzf > selected
```

1. `find * -type f` generates a list of all files in the current directory and subdirectories, which is piped to `fzf`.
2. `fzf` displays this list interactively for you to search and select.
3. The chosen file path is saved to `selected`.

### Example 2: Launch `fzf` Without Input List

```bash
fzf
```

Without an input list, `fzf` scans the file system from the current directory, allowing you to select a file or directory directly.

### Example 3: Open a Selected File in `vim`

```bash
vim $(fzf)
```

1. `fzf` provides a file selection interface.
2. The selected file path is passed to `vim`, which opens it for editing.

### Example 4: Multi-Select Mode with `fzf`

To enable multi-select mode, press `TAB` to mark items. Use `--multi` option for unlimited selection.

```bash
fzf -m
```

## Advanced Search Syntax

In extended-search mode (enabled by default), you can use multiple search terms and special tokens:

| Token       | Match Type                   | Description                                      |
|-------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `sbtrkt`    | Fuzzy match                  | Matches items that contain "sbtrkt"              |
| `'wild`     | Exact match                  | Matches items that include "wild"                |
| `^music`    | Prefix exact match           | Matches items that start with "music"            |
| `.mp3$`     | Suffix exact match           | Matches items that end with ".mp3"               |
| `!fire`     | Inverse exact match          | Matches items that do not include "fire"         |
| `!^music`   | Inverse prefix exact match   | Matches items that do not start with "music"     |
| `!.mp3$`    | Inverse suffix exact match   | Matches items that do not end with ".mp3"        |
| `|`         | OR                           | Combines terms as an OR operator                 |

### Example Query

To match entries starting with "core" and ending with "go", "rb", or "py":

```text
^core go$ | rb$ | py$
```
